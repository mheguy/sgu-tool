search for "WORD (nnnn WTW)" to create a redirect page, where "(nnnn)" is the episode number, then edit that page with:

#REDIRECT
[[SGU_Episode_NNNN#wtw]]
[[Category:What's the Word?]]

Instead of adding an entire episode to a category, once redirects have been created, we suggest typing "redirect(s) created for" in front of the text you hide in the markup that follows the category name, seen in the "page categories" template above
